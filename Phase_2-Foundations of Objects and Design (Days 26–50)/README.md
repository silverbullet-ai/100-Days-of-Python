# Phase 2 — Foundations of Objects and Design (Days 26–50)

This phase marks the transition from **writing Python programs** to **designing Python systems**.

Phase 2 was not about learning OOP syntax mechanically.
It was about understanding **how Python models the real world**, how objects interact, and how to design code that is structured, predictable, and maintainable.

This phase reshaped my thinking from *procedural scripts* to *object-oriented design*.

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

By the end of Phase 2, I aimed to:

- Understand Python’s object model deeply  
- Learn Object-Oriented Programming the right way  
- Design classes with clear responsibilities  
- Combine data and behavior meaningfully  
- Write scalable, maintainable, and readable code  
- Develop system-level thinking before entering real-world Python

## 📅 Phase Duration

- **Day 26 → Day 50**  
- **Total Days:** 25  
- **Focus:** Objects, design discipline, and system thinking

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Python Object Foundations
- Python object model (identity, type, value)
- Variables as references
- Mutability vs immutability
- How Python handles objects internally

---

### 🔹 Core Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes & instances
- Constructors (`__init__`) and `self`
- Instance variables vs class variables
- Methods and behavior modeling
- Encapsulation and access conventions

---

### 🔹 OOP Design Principles
- Composition vs inheritance
- Inheritance and `super()`
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism
- Duck typing (behavior over type)

---

### 🔹 Python Internals & Expressiveness
- Magic (dunder) methods
- `__str__`, `__repr__`, and object comparisons
- Operator overloading
- Dataclasses
- Immutability as a design choice

---

### 🔹 Execution Model & Control Flow
- Iterables and iterators
- Generators and lazy execution
- Function decorators
- Class-based decorators
- Context managers and the `with` statement

---

### 🔹 Design, Refactoring & Robust Systems
- Mini OOP design patterns
- Refactoring procedural code into OOP
- Error handling in object-oriented systems
- Designing safe failure paths
- Writing clean and predictable systems

---

## 🛠️ Practice & Integration
