# Day 50 — Phase 2 Revision & Consolidation

This day is dedicated to **revising and consolidating Phase 2**:
**Foundations of Objects and Design (Days 26–50)**.

Instead of learning new concepts, the focus is on:
- Revisiting all major OOP ideas
- Connecting concepts together
- Strengthening mental models
- Validating understanding through a mini project

This day marks the **official completion of Phase 2**.
