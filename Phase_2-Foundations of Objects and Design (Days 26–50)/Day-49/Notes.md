Build a simple system that:

* Stores student records
* Adds new students
* Displays student data
* Searches for students
* Handles invalid operations safely



---

## Design Breakdown



### Student Class

Responsibilities:

* Store student data
* Display student details



### StudentManager Class

Responsibilities:

* Manage student collection
* Add, search, and display students
* Handle errors



---

## Design Principles Used

* Encapsulation → data inside classes
* Single Responsibility → one purpose per class
* Error handling → safe failure paths
* Clear interfaces → readable method names

## Mental Rule

> Small systems should be \*\*clean\*\*, not clever.
