# Day 20 Notes — Revision Highlights



## Core Concepts Checklist



✔ Variables \& data types  
✔ Operators \& conditions  
✔ Loops (for, while, nested)  
✔ Functions \& arguments  
✔ Scope (local vs global)

✔ Lists (methods, slicing, copying)  
✔ Tuples (immutability)  
✔ Sets (uniqueness \& operations)  
✔ Dictionaries (methods \& nesting)  
✔ Strings (methods \& practice problems)

## Mental Model Reminder



* Lists → ordered, mutable
* Tuples → ordered, immutable
* Sets → unordered, unique
* Dictionaries → key–value meaning

## Rule to Remember



Clean input → process → return/output

Avoid globals. Prefer functions.
