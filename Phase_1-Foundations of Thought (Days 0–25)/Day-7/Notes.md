# Day 7 Notes — Loop Control



## break



* Immediately exits the loop
* Used when no further iteration is needed



Example:
for i in range(10):
if i == 5:
break



---

## continue



* Skips the current iteration
* Loop continues with the next iteration



Example:
for i in range(5):
if i == 2:
continue
print(i)



---

## pass



* Does nothing
* Used as a placeholder where a statement is required



Example:
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
pass
else:
print(i)



---

## Why pass exists



* To avoid syntax errors
* To write code structure first
* To fill logic later



---

## Key Difference



* break → stops the loop
* continue → skips an iteration
* pass → does nothing, continues normally
