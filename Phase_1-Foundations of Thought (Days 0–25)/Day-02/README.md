# Day 2 — Variables, Data Types \& Input



Today I learned how Python stores data using variables and how different
data types behave.



Topics covered:

* Variables and naming rules
* Common data types
* Dynamic typing in Python
* Taking input from the user



This day builds the foundation for all future logic and programs.
