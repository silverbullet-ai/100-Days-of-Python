# Day 16 — Dictionaries (Key–Value Data)



Today I learned how Python stores data using dictionaries,
which map keys to values.



Topics covered:

* Creating dictionaries
* Accessing values using keys
* Adding and updating entries
* Deleting entries
* Iterating over dictionaries



Dictionaries are essential for real-world Python programs.
