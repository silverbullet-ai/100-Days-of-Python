# Day 0 Notes


## What is Python?
Python is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language** created by Guido van Rossum.

It emphasizes:
- Readability
- Simplicity
- Expressiveness

Python allows programmers to focus more on **problem solving** rather than **syntax complexity**.

## Why Python?
Python was designed to:
- Reduce boilerplate code
- Read almost like English
- Be beginner-friendly yet powerful

Python is used in:
- Web development
- Data science
- AI/ML
- Automation
- System scripting

## How Python Works (Very High Level)
1. You write Python code (`.py` file)
2. Python interpreter reads it line by line
3. Code is converted to bytecode
4. Bytecode runs on Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

Unlike C/C++, Python does NOT need manual compilation.

## Learning Mindset for This Journey
- Consistency > Intensity
- Understanding > Memorizing
- Clean code > Clever code
- Patience is non-negotiable
