# Phase 1 — Foundations of Thought (Days 0–25)

This phase marks the **foundation** of my *100 Days of Python* journey.

Phase 1 was not about rushing syntax or finishing Python quickly.  
It was about **building the correct way of thinking**, understanding how Python works internally, and developing clean programming habits.

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

By the end of Phase 1, I aimed to:

* Build strong fundamentals in Python
* Understand core programming concepts deeply
* Write clean, readable, and safe code
* Develop confidence before moving into advanced topics

## 📅 Phase Duration

* **Day 0 → Day 25**
* Total Days: **26**
* Focus: **Foundations, clarity, and discipline**

### 🔹 Functions \& Logic

* Defining and calling functions
* Function arguments (positional, default, keyword)

## 🧭 Phase 1 Takeaway — Foundations of Thought

Phase 1 changed how I **translate problem-solving into code**.

Earlier, I focused on:
- Solving problems conceptually  
- Thinking through steps in my head  
- Knowing *what* the answer should be  

After Phase 1, I focus on:
- Expressing problem-solving clearly in Python  
- Turning logic into structured, executable scripts  
- Choosing correct data structures for the problem  
- Handling invalid input and edge cases deliberately  

This phase taught me that programming is not about syntax.
It is about **making problem-solving executable**.

I learned to stop asking:
- “How do I solve this problem?”

And start asking:
- “How do I express this solution as a program?”
- “What data structure represents this problem best?”
- “What assumptions will break when input changes?”
- “How should the program behave when things go wrong?”

Phase 1 completed the transition from:
- solving problems  
to  
- writing scripts  

It built the foundation required before abstraction,
object-oriented design, and system-level thinking could begin.
