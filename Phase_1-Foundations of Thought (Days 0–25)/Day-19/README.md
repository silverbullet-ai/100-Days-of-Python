# Day 19 — String Problems \& Practice



Today I practiced solving common string problems using
methods, slicing, loops, and conditions.



Topics covered:

* Reversing strings
* Counting characters
* Palindrome checking
* Word counting
* String cleaning



Practice makes string manipulation intuitive.
