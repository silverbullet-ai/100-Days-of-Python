# Day 6 Notes — Nested Loops



## What is a Nested Loop?



A nested loop is a loop **inside another loop**.

* Outer loop → controls rows
* Inner loop → controls columns



---

## How Nested Loops Work



For each iteration of the outer loop,
the inner loop runs **completely**.



Example:
Outer loop runs 3 times  
Inner loop runs 5 times each time

Total executions = 3 × 5 = 15

## Why Patterns Matter



Patterns help in:

* Understanding logic flow
* Visualizing loop execution
* Building strong fundamentals
* Preparing for problem-solving and interviews
*

## Important Rule



Always understand:

* Which loop controls rows
* Which loop controls columns
