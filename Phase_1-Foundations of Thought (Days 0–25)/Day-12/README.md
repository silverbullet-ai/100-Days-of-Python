# Day 12 — List Operations \& Methods



Today I learned how to modify lists using built-in methods
and how to work with list data more effectively.



Topics covered:

* Adding elements to lists
* Removing elements from lists
* Common list methods
* Checking membership and length



Lists become powerful when combined with their methods.
