# Day 1 — Python Foundations 🐍


Today marks the official start of my **100 Days of Python** journey.



## What I learned today:


* What Python is and why it is used
* How Python code is executed
* Writing my first Python program
* Understanding print statements and comments


This day is about **clarity, not speed**.
Strong foundations lead to strong systems.
