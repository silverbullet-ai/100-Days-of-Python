* Simplicity
* Productivity



It is widely used in:

* Easy to read and write
* Fewer lines of code
* Huge community and libraries

## How Python Works (Internally)



1. You write Python code (`.py` file)
2. Python Interpreter reads it line by line
3. Code is converted to bytecode
4. Bytecode runs on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

Python executes **top to bottom**.
