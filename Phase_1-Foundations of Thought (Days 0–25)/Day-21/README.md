# Day 21 — Error Handling (try / except)



Today I learned how to handle runtime errors in Python using
try, except, else, and finally blocks.



Topics covered:

* Runtime errors
* try and except
* Handling specific exceptions
* else and finally
* Writing safe programs



Error handling makes programs robust and user-friendly.
