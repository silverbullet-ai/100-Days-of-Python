# Day 4 Notes — Conditional Statements



## What is a Conditional Statement?



A conditional statement allows a program to **execute code based on a condition**.

The condition must evaluate to:

* True
* False

---

## The if Statement



Syntax:

if condition:
statement

If the condition is True, the block runs.
If False, it is skipped.

---

## if-else Statement



Syntax:

if condition:
statement
else:
statement

Only one block will execute.

---

## if-elif-else Ladder



Used when multiple conditions are involved.

Syntax:

if condition1:
statement
elif condition2:
statement
else:
statement

Python checks conditions from top to bottom.

---

## Nested if



An if statement inside another if.

Used for more complex decision logic.

---

## Indentation (VERY IMPORTANT)



Python uses indentation instead of braces `{}`.

* Indentation defines blocks
* Wrong indentation = error
* Standard indentation = 4 spaces

---

## Key Rule



Conditions must result in True or False.
