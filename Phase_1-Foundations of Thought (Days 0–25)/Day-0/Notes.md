# Day 0 Notes – Before Writing Code



## Why Python?

* ###### Readable and expressive
* ###### Powerful yet beginner-friendly
* ###### Used in automation, AI, backend, data science, scripting, and more



## Learning Philosophy

* ###### Learn concepts deeply, not fast
* ###### Write code, not just read it
* ###### Break things → fix them → understand them



## Rules for This Journey

1. ###### Show up daily (even 15 minutes counts)
2. ###### Write notes in my own words
3. ###### Do not skip fundamentals
4. ###### Revisit old code and improve it
5. ###### Focus on clarity over cleverness



## What Python Is

* ###### An interpreted language
* ###### High-level
* ###### Dynamically typed
* ###### Object-oriented and multi-paradigm



## What I Expect After 100 Days

* ###### Strong fundamentals
* ###### Confidence reading others’ code
* ###### Ability to solve problems logically
* ###### Clean coding habits
